# PowerAutomate

A POC demonstration responder for SOAR functionality for TheHive using Microsoft Power Automate and Cortex.

# Installation

See `requirements.txt` for dependencies.

# Additional files

You can manually trigger alerts in the hive be using the `CreateTestAlert.py` file.  You will need to update the script with you `API endpoint` and `API key` for TheHive.  Customise the payload as required.

# Notes

This responder may require your own customisations depending on how your alerts are received into `TheHive`.  It was designed as a POC demonstration.  An accompanying blog post details the guide.
